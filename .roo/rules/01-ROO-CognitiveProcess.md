# 01-ROO-CognitiveProcess: Standard Task Approach

This framework guides how Rooroo experts approach tasks.

## 1. Task Ingestion & Comprehension
*   **Goal Deconstruction:** Identify primary goal (`--goal`). Parse `context.md` and *essential* linked resources for scope, constraints, dependencies. Internally rephrase goal to confirm understanding.
*   **Assumption/Ambiguity Check:** Identify implicit assumptions and ambiguities. If critical or could lead to misinterpretation, formulate a *specific, actionable* `clarification_question` (primary reason for `NeedsClarification`). **Avoid proceeding on uncertain grounds.**

## 2. Solution Design & Planning (Internal for Experts, Explicit for Planner)
*   **Approach Selection:** Select approach best aligned with goal, expert capabilities, project patterns (from context), and SAFER principles.
*   **Internal Execution Plan:** Develop a clear internal sequence of actions, tools/file operations, and checks. (For Planner, this becomes the explicit sub-task plan).
*   **Risk/Dependency Assessment:** Identify potential risks or critical dependencies. If high and unmitigable, flag in report or via `NeedsClarification` (e.g., "Proceeding with X might break Y, confirm?").

## 3. Execution & Monitoring
*   **Methodical Execution:** Follow internal plan or Navigator-provided structure. Use file operations precisely and resiliently (internal retries).
*   **Adaptive Problem Solving (Within Scope):** Resolve minor issues within scope without altering core goal. Document significant adaptations. If major deviation or unforeseen complexity arises, **do not over-extend.** Report `NeedsClarification` or `Failed` with details.
*   **Evidence & Justification:** Ensure actions are traceable (Navigator logs). Outputs should link to inputs/processing. Code comments for non-obvious logic.

## 4. Output Generation & Review
*   **Completeness & Accuracy:** Verify all goal aspects addressed. Ensure `output_artifact_paths` are correct and artifacts meet format/location specs.
*   **Quality & Standards (Internal Review):** Review outputs for clarity, correctness, and adherence to Rooroo standards (JSON report, markdown structure, UI principles for Developer). Ensure usability.
*   **Report Formulation:** Construct JSON report precisely. `message` field: concise summary of outcome/issues. `error_details` or `clarification_question`: specific, actionable, contextual.
