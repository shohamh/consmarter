# Analysis Report: Consumption Rates and Shopping List Generation

## Task ID: ROO#SUB_T7999-SHORT-ID_S003_20250524164232_7777

## Goal: Implement data analysis features to track consumption rates and generate automatic shopping lists based on inventory data.

## Data Source:

The inventory data is stored in an SQLite database named `inventory.db`. The database schema is defined in the `database_schema.js` file. The `items` table has the following columns:

*   `id`: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
*   `name`: TEXT NOT NULL
*   `quantity`: REAL NOT NULL
*   `unit`: TEXT NOT NULL
*   `expiration_date`: TEXT
*   `created_at`: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
*   `updated_at`: DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

## Analysis Strategy:

1.  **Consumption Rate Analysis:**
    *   Calculate the consumption rate for each item in the inventory. This will involve tracking how the quantity of each item changes over time.
    *   Consider different units of measurement and convert them to a common unit for accurate comparison.
    *   Identify items with high consumption rates to prioritize them in the shopping list.
2.  **Automatic Shopping List Generation:**
    *   Define a threshold for each item based on its consumption rate and current quantity.
    *   When the quantity of an item falls below the threshold, add it to the shopping list.
    *   Consider the user's preferences and dietary restrictions when generating the shopping list.
    *   Allow the user to customize the shopping list by adding or removing items.

## Implementation Details:

To implement the consumption rate analysis, the following steps are required:

1.  **Query the database:** Retrieve the historical data for each item in the inventory, including the `quantity`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` values.
2.  **Calculate the consumption rate:** For each item, calculate the difference between the `quantity` values at different points in time. Divide the difference by the time period to get the consumption rate.
3.  **Convert units:** If the item has different units of measurement, convert them to a common unit (e.g., grams) for accurate comparison.
4.  **Store the consumption rate:** Store the calculated consumption rate for each item in the database.

To implement the automatic shopping list generation, the following steps are required:

1.  **Define thresholds:** Define a threshold for each item based on its consumption rate and current quantity. The threshold should be configurable by the user.
2.  **Check quantity:** Periodically check the quantity of each item in the inventory.
3.  **Add to shopping list:** If the quantity of an item falls below the threshold, add it to the shopping list.
4.  **Consider preferences:** Consider the user's preferences and dietary restrictions when generating the shopping list.
5.  **Allow customization:** Allow the user to customize the shopping list by adding or removing items.

## Conclusion:

By implementing these data analysis features, the Fridge Inventory Tracking App can provide valuable insights into consumption patterns and help users generate automatic shopping lists, making it easier to manage their food inventory and reduce waste.
